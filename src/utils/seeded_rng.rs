// this can be moved to a value inside the dungeon type (since all rng should be per dungeon) if ever needed but itd need to be passed through to every function that needs it.
// it would also avoid the Rc overhead (and unsafecell but i think thats basically 0 overhead).
// technically doesnt need to be thread local since its only used in the main thread, but it does need it to call non const functions in the static...

// this is basically a 1:1 copy of ThreadRng but with a seed, thus its logic of unsafeCell usage applies here as well.

/// A thread-local RNG that can be seeded.
///
/// All [SeededRNG]s on the same thread point to the same internal state, and thus will be affected by each other, including setting a seed.
